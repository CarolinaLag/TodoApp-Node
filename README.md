# Build a Todo List

_A todolist made with Express, Mongo and EJS as a school assignment_

Examples of functionality of the Todo List:

- Save all todo models in the database
- Create, read, edit and delete from the todo list
- Add pagination 
- Sort the list by date

---

## Installation
Use following command to install:

```
npm i

```
## How to run
- Clone the repo and install all neccessary dependencies
- Run `npm start`

**Note that the URI of the database and localhost port is in a hidden .env file that is not included in this repository, and you will therefore need your own MongoDB Atlas account to use this TodoApp.**

## Naming conventions

### Variables

- Use let instead of var
- When naming variables use **camelCase**

* Eg `let newTodotask = new Todotask(task);`

### Functions

- Function names should use _camelCase_

### Classes

- Class names should use **PascalCase**
* Eg `class Todo`
